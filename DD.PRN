Hello Emma,

I downloaded csv file from http://vmj-hlcms01-prod.healthline.com/report_news_as_of_today .
It has only three fields Path,Title,All terms. As per instruction document https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LFb06h2XNA6dPYrQUR-cD6kiUnqjEgRboStV5kfJG10/edit
Canonical, Title, Publish Date, Author, Landscape Image, Summary, Category filed should be there in downloaded file. 

We assume that we will be provided the CSV with all above fields except body field. We have to extract the body field using http://jsonpath.com/? by following instructions and copy it to 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10PtXogKtbgOmsr4_gCMCyoHaiw9sshHUjRVSh8jMWd8/edit#gid=0

Considering minimum 30 articles per day, our estimate is 4-5 hours daily. 

Thanks,
